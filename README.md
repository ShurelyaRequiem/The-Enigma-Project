The Enigma Project is a one year project, currently in public beta. It's a completely open source game, where anyone can contribute and participate, artists, musicians, social network influencers, developers, story writers, anyone who has an idea and can provide it. Anything may be added, but for something to be removed, there has to be a consensus. It's an experiment to see what the world will create together if given the opportunity.

The current version of The Enigma Project is a one month beta test.
